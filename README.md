#BooksAPI-using-Go

A simple API that provides basic Book details like its title, author(s) and price as mentioned on [Bookswagon](https://www.bookswagon.com). The book details were scraped from the site using Colly and the API was made with the help of Gin Web Framework.

The API has three endpoints, one for getting all books, one for getting book by its ID and the last one for adding a new book to the database.
